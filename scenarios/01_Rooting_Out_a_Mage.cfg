    # This campaign, as originally written, had no definite time or
    # place.  There was a vague reference to "the eastern reaches of
    # the kingdom of Wesnoth".  In a later revision the epilogue hints
    # that Arvith may have traveled with the elf-lord Kalenz, but this is
    # not much of a constraint as Kalenz was around in 1YW and at
    # least until the beginning of HttT in 517 YW.
    #
    # Maghre has to be within reach of the orcs, but in a time and
    # place where there haven't been orc raids for generations. I (ESR)
    # think this limits us to *western* Wesnoth, orc raids having been a
    # chronic problem in the northeast even during the Kingdom's strongest
    # periods. The logical time would be shortly after the death of
    # Haldric IV in 350, the beginning of the First Dark Age.  I'm arbitrarily
    # setting it at 363; Kalenz began his wanderings ten years later, so the
    # timing for Arvith to meet him later in life isn't bad.  (Later moved
    # to 363 so the timing of the Epilogue. A-Red's backstory changes works
    # better.)

    # Placing the campaign is a little trickier.  Our main textual
    # clue is that there is a dense wood, said by legend to be
    # haunted, a few days' ride north.  Later, the boss's keep is said to
    # be still further north.  Neither of these directions has plot importance,
    # but they do suggest a locale for Maghre - near the Grey Woods.  The
    # battle maps exclude it from being in a featureless plain, though;
    # there are hills to the south and west.
    #
    # So let it be written, so let it be done.  See the tracking map
    # for the result.

Wars and the rumor of wars touched them not, until the day a dark mage settled in the region and began seeking sacrifices for his evil summonings."

The people looked to him for help and leadership. He found weapons half-forgotten from the times of their sires and grandsires hanging in many houses, and bade the villagers to take them down and clean and oil them. He set the smiths of Maghre to making spearheads and ax-blades for the rest."

Baran sent out that call."

Excerpt from the journal of Baran of Maghre

If I could but face this ‘Mordak’! I think my magic might prove stronger than his. But he bides in the hills, well-guarded by his servants, and I muster frightened peasants to fight his minions with blades and sticks. I need my brother; he always had a better head for battle than I.

Will he heed the call? I do not know if he has kept the amulet; we have not spoken since that evil day at Toen Caric. If he will not come for me, perhaps he will return to aid our village in its hour of desperate need."
