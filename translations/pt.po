"The last of Mordak’s servants arrived this morning bearing the news of his "

"man. Mordak was always reckless. This whole desperate scheme was his, and I "
"suppose I could blame him for everything that we have suffered through if it "
"still mattered. It was he who brought the wrath of the orcs down on us, too. "
"But all the same, he managed to accomplish what he set out to do. I still "
"cannot believe the finality of what has happened; until now we had always "
"managed to make it through somehow.\n"
"\n"
"We had hoped to deliver the mage to Tairach in return for our lives. I do "
"not know what the warlord wants with this man, but he matches the "
"description. I suppose that Mordak’s plan would have worked perfectly if not "
"for the appearance of the horse warriors. Now they are coming here, led by a "

"O último dos servos de Mordak chegou esta manhã com a notícia da sua morte, "

"Mordak sempre foi imprudente. Todo este esquema desesperado era dele, e, "
"suponho, poderia culpar-o por tudo o que temos sofrido se ainda importasse. "
"Foi ele quem trouxe a ira dos orcs sobre nós. Mas, mesmo assim, conseguiu "
"realizar a que se propôs a fazer. Ainda não posso acreditar no que "
"aconteceu; até agora tivemos sempre conseguido fazer-o através de alguma "
"forma.\n"
"\n"
"Esperávamos oferecer o mago Tairach em troca das nossas vidas. Não sei o que "
"o senhor da guerra quer com este homem, mas corresponde à descrição. Suponho "
"que o plano de Mordak teria funcionado perfeitamente se não fosse a "
"aparência dos guerreiros a cavalo. Agora estão a vir para cá, lideradas por "
"um homem que rumores dizem ser o irmão deste mago. Se isso for verdade, isso "
"vai parar em nada nem eu consigo qualquer coisa, se detiverem Mordak."
