"We’ve been searching three days for Baran, and turned up nothing. My best "
"hunch was to head north into the borderlands, where the necromancer’s "
"minions could safely hide; everywhere else is more farmland. At first I "
"thought the search might be useless, but late in the first day we found a "
"set of tracks. Some of them had been made by skeletal feet.\n"
"\n"
"We’re close enough to be certain now: those tracks are heading into the Grey "
"Woods. No one from Maghre or any of the other villages has gone into that "
"forest in living memory. Stories have been passed down for generations "
"warning against it. Supposedly the place is haunted by lost souls who hunger "
"for the living, and anyone who dies there is doomed to join them."
